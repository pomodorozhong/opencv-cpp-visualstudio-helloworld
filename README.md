# Visual Studio C++ OpenCV HelloWorld

This is a demo repo for using Visual Studio C++ with 64-bit / 32-bit OpenCV.

The path I use in the .props file is the default path set by OpenCV installer.

## OpenCV 64-bit

The main branch is using `opencv420 64-bit` which you can download the pre-build binary from OpenCV's official website.

## OpenCV 32-bit

The other branch `32bit-opencv2413` is using `opencv2413 32-bit` which you can download the pre-build binary from OpenCV's official website.
